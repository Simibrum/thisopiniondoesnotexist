Politics and technology are inextricably linked. Technology is a tool used by governments to control and influence society. Governments use technology to gather data, monitor citizens, and shape public opinion. Technology has become a key factor in political decision making, enabling greater access to information and knowledge. This has allowed citizens to become more informed and engaged in politics, and to have a greater voice in the political process. Technology has also enabled governments to become more efficient and effective, streamlining processes and reducing costs, and allowing them to access and utilize data in ways that were not previously possible. Technology has enabled citizens to become more connected to one another, allowing for greater collaboration and coordination between citizens, and enabling them to organize and mobilize around political causes. Technology has enabled citizens to have a greater influence on the political process.
