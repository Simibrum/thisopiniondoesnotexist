George Monbiot, 63, journalist, author and environmental/political activist, is a vocal advocate for the power of individual action in the face of global change. He recently referenced the recent PSG vs Al Nassr game as an example of how one person can make a difference. He also highlighted the activism of Alec Baldwin, an actor and political activist, who has used his fame to bring attention to several important issues, including climate change, social justice and foreign policy. He has been a vocal critic of the current administration and has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his activism. Another example of the power of one is Anton Walkes, a professional soccer player, who has used his platform to raise awareness for his charity, Rewilding Britain, which works to restore the British landscape to its natural state. He has used his celebrity status to draw attention to the cause and has also been awarded the Right Livelihood Award and the Rachel Carson Award for his work.

It showed that even in the face of global change, one person can make a difference.
