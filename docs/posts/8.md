As a 28-year-old opinion writer for a national newspaper with an influential voice, I am passionate, articulate, thoughtful, and considerate. I have a keen eye for social justice and have been recognised with an award for my journalism. I want to explore the power of passion through the lens of three seemingly disparate entities: Man United vs Burnley, Beth Mead, and Ellie Goulding. 


When it comes to sports, passion is often seen as the difference between winning and losing. Such was the case when Manchester United faced off against Burnley in the 2019/20 season. While United had several players on the field, it was the passion of their team that truly drove them forward. Every tackle, every pass, every shot was driven by passion and intensity, and it was that passion that finally allowed them to triumph in the end. It was a perfect example of how the power of passion can help a team to succeed.


Passion is a powerful force that can drive us to do great things. This is especially true in the world of art and entertainment. Beth Mead is a perfect example of someone that has used her passion to succeed. Mead is a professional soccer player who plays for Arsenal and has made it to the senior England team. She is known for her skill and technique but it is her passion that sets her apart from other players. Not only does Mead have a great work ethic and dedication to the game, she also has a desire to constantly improve and push the boundaries of her craft. Mead is a leader on the field and her enthusiasm and drive are infectious, inspiring her teammates to reach their fullest potential.


The power of passion is evident in the music world, too. Ellie Goulding is a perfect example of a passionate musician. She has been in the music industry for over a decade and her passion is evident in her work. Her songwriting is filled with raw emotion and she puts her all into each and every performance. Her commitment to her craft is what makes her performances so captivating and memorable. She is a perfect example of how passion and hard work can help a musician to succeed. Her music has reached a worldwide audience and her influence has been felt by millions. Goulding is a testament to the power of passion in music and an inspiration to those who have a dream of making it in the industry.


In conclusion, it is evident that the power of passion can be seen in many areas of life, from sports, to the arts, to music. Man United vs Burnley was a prime example of passion in sport, with each team giving their all to achieve victory. Beth Mead is a shining example of passion in the arts, showing an incredible drive and determination to be the best. And Ellie Goulding is a great example of passion in music, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to her craft. Passion has been a fuel for success in all of these areas, and is necessary for anyone wishing to achieve greatness.
