George Monbiot has made a name for himself as an activist fighting for climate change, environmentalism, social justice and Rewilding Britain. On Boxing Day, millions of people take part in the festive tradition of tracking Santa via the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). In 2020, there was a special surprise in store with the launch of The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, a project close to George Monbiot’s heart. This beautiful story of courage, friendship and hope captures the importance of looking after the environment, addressing social justice and inequality and spreading the Christmas spirit.

These issues have a particular relevance to Boxing Day, when Santa Tracker NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) is used to track Santa around the world, and when The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse serves as a reminder of the hope and optimism of Christmas.


Santa Tracker NORAD has become a Christmas tradition, with millions of people all over the world tuning in to follow Santa's progress on his journey to deliver gifts all night on Christmas Eve. Each year, NORAD works with the US and Canadian military forces to monitor and track Santa's progress, and it is a moment of joy and community spirit in the midst of a difficult year. This year, NORAD tracked Santa and the reindeer on their journey in association with The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, a celebrated best-selling book by Charlie Mackesy, which has become a source of inspiration and comfort for many during the lockdown. The book’s messages of hope and kindness, and its call to care for the natural environment, are especially pertinent for this holiday season. 

George Monbiot, a passionate and award-winning activist for climate change and environmentalism, is particularly moved by the messages of hope and care for the environment in The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, as his work focuses on the importance of looking after our land, sea and air. Monbiot also dedicates his time to social justice and inequality, putting forward a vision to rewild Britain and to address the root causes of poverty, as well as advocating for a new approach to foreign policy which puts human rights and the environment at the forefront.

His recent books focus on the importance of Rewilding Britain and restoring the balance of nature in the United Kingdom. He calls for a new approach to foreign policy, based on environmental and social justice, and a commitment to environmental stewardship. 

Monbiot's work has been recognized internationally, and he has been called upon by governments, corporations, and other organizations around the world to help create positive change.
