Rangers faced off against Aberdeen at Ibrox Stadium in a hotly contested match, with a key focus on the midfield battle and the performances of the respective strikers.

Despite an early dominance from Everton, it was Southampton who took the lead with a goal from Shane Long in the 28th minute. However, Dominic Calvert-Lewin responded quickly, equalizing for Everton in the 35th minute. Both teams threw their all into the game, with Southampton pushing to keep their lead, and Everton pushing for the winner.
